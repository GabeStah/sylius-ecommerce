<h1 class="text-center">Raritan's Marine Sanitation Products Legacy</h1>
<p>For more than fifty years, Raritan has been meeting our customers needs for outstanding service and product
  reliability establishing ourselves as "the most dependable name on the water." Our customers continue to be our focus,
  and the primary source of the ideas for our new <a title="marine sanitation device"
                                                     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_sanitation_device">marine
    sanitation</a> products and product enhancements. The median length of service for Raritan employees is about twenty
  years, an unusual number in the fast changing world we live and work in. It is a measure of the dedication of the men
  and women who design, manufacture, distribute and support Raritan's <a title="electroscan"
                                                                         href="/en_US/products/electroscan">marine
    sanitation products</a>.</p>
<p>Raritan, for example, was the first company to develop a flow through sewage waste treatment system suitable for
  small boats, well before there were any legal requirements. That product evolved into the <a title="ElectroScan "
                                                                                               href="/en_US/products/electroscan">ElectroScan </a>which
  is the gold standard for small onboard treatment systems.In the tradition of constantly improving our products and
  product offerings, we are pleased to introduce product enhancements and new products in our <a
