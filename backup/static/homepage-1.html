<p>
  Raritan Engineering Company Inc. started with one simple marine product, a <a title="manual marine toilet"
                                                                                href="/en_US/product-categories/manual-marine-toilets">
  manual marine toilet </a
>designed for the Navy. This first of its kind manual
  <a
    title="marine toilet "
    href="/en_US/product-categories/marine-toilets"
  >marine toilet </a
  >was built fully of bronze and allowed the user to draw in sea water while
  also discharging the contents by simply pumping the handle. That first toilet
  was named the PH. In addition to its robust material it featured leather seals
  for reliability and durability. Today a very similar toilet still exists in
  Raritans lineup of marine toilets. The
  <a title="PHII" href="/en_US/products/phii">PHII</a> has undergone
  many changes over the years but the original design to bring water in while
  also discharging had remained the same. Raritan differs from most of its
  competition in many ways.

  In addition to being a pioneer in the marine manual toilet business Raritan
  then introduced an electric macerating toilet - the
  <a title="Crown Head" href="/en_US/products/crown-head">Crown Head</a>.
  Some of which still exist in the field today! First introduced in the late
  1960&rsquo;s we still will occasionally get one dated from the late
  1960&rsquo;s or early 1970&rsquo;s back on our exchange program. We wonder how
  many companies today can claim they have had a toilet in operation for more
  than 45 years? While the Crown Head still remains popular among many the most
  impressive introduction by far was the
  <a title="Marine Elegance" href="/en_US/products/marine-elegance"
  >Marine Elegance</a
  >
  toilet which brings the ability to install a macerating toilet in a very tight
  area. While Vacuum toilets were all the rage in the early 1990&rsquo;s the
  popularity is decreasing as vacuum leaks cause headaches for owners. The
  development of the
  <a title="Marine Elegance" href="/en_US/products/marine-elegance"
  >Marine Elegance</a
  >
  required that it fit in a small area, have a powerful quiet flush and any
  required maintenance be easy. In addition, we developed a unique mounting
  system that allows for extremely clean lines, a favorite for those that like a
  clean bathroom!

  Of course, with toilet waste comes environmental responsibility and that is
  where the first electrochemical chlorinator was born. Raritan introduced a way
  to treat the toilet waste with a bottle of bleach long before any rules or
  regulations about boat toilets even existed. Granted in today&rsquo;s world it
  would not be proper but it was a step to try and protect the waters we boat in
  rather than having people discharge raw waste. By the time the
  <a

  came to be Raritan had partnered with Diamond Shamrock and introduced a Type I

  that still substantially outperforms the Type I standard! The Electroscan is
  by far the most popular Type I device on the market today and remains a top
  choice for those that choose to be environmentally friendly. While it is legal
  to discharge overboard outside the 3 mile limit we find many choose to do so
  inside without treatment. Installing a Type I device ensures that you are not
  discharging raw sewage inside the 3 mile limit.<br/>
  Building reliable

    href="/en_US/products/electroscan-hold-n-treat"
  >marine sanitation products </a
  >is key to the core values at Raritan but more important than reliable marine
  sanitation products is knowing that no matter how well they are built things
  happen. Raritan is proud to provide telephone support throughout the week to
  allow users to have questions answered, or emergency parts shipped on the same
  day. We strive to get every customer back out on the water or up and running
  as quickly as possible. An investment in a Raritan marine sanitation product
  is always backed by unmatched after sale support.
