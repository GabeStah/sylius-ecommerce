var textForPages = ["","TO OUR CUSTOMERS, TRADING PARTNERS AND FRIENDS,            Raritan customers like to ask questions and they range from the simple to the very complex. The         challenge in this catalog is to present enough information to shed light on the simple yet still offer a path         to understanding the complex. We show our product line in a simplified fashion and suggest where to         seek additional information from our website or customer service personnel. To print a catalog containing         57 years’ worth of revisions to the PH manual would have been cumbersome and not of much interest to         someone who is just buying their first PH. For those unfamiliar, the PH was the manual Marine head on         which Raritan Engineering Company, Inc. was started in 1958.           Whether you are seeing this catalog in booklet format or seeing a virtual copy on our website, it’s helpful         to know the additional information on products and parts are available on the website. If you cannot find         what you want, please call our customer service representatives and they can help you find what you need.         As a company we believe you should be able to get the information necessary to use and maintain your         Raritan product. We go to great lengths to ensure that you can get that information. Our employees are our         greatest asset and they know that outstanding customer service is what keeps customers coming back.           In the past year we have made an effort to update the Marine head and we have designed slow close seats         for both Marine size bowls and Household size bowls with special feature of stoppers that prevents seats         from sliding sideways. Because the Marine environment is harsh, fasteners tend to corrode. There are no         exposed fasteners to corrode on our slow close seats. It may seem like a simple thing but boat owners who         have struggled to keep seats functional and clean will recognize the importance of such a simple thing.          We have also made improvements to our PH head, now dubbed the PH SUPERFLUSH. Changes have been         made to allow direct and fast replacement of competitors’ heads to provide effortless pumping. This is an         example of our efforts at continuous improvement that is driven by customer requests.          Don’t overlook plumbing fittings and valves from our partner Tru-Design. These fittings are extremely cost-         effective, durable and can be installed to meet ABYC standards.           We have made a number of improvements to other Raritan products. Our 87 Icemaker for example has         several improvements. Fresh head has been improved to make it more reliable and operation more         intuitive. PSTEX (Purasan) system now has substantial improvements as a result of the growing number of         applications and the feedback users have provided us.          We welcome any suggestions you may have for product improvements and for the support we provide for         our products.           Wishing you wonderful boating seasons in coming years,              Arthur J. “Bret” Bretnall, Jr.         President           2","MANUAL TOILETS                                                                         PG.4                       ELECTRIC TOILETS                                                                       PG.10                       WASTE TREATMENT SYSTEMS                                                                PG. 18                      MACERATOR PUMP                                                                         PG. 24                      MARINE COMPOSITE FITTINGS                                                              PG. 26                       NAVIGATIONAL AIDS                                                                      PG. 28                       TANK MONITORS                                                                          PG. 29                      ICE MAKERS                                                                               PG. 30                      WATER HEATERS                                                                          PG. 32                       STRAINERS                                                                                PG. 34                       CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE                                                               PG. 35                                                                                                                                              3","As a premier manufacturer of marine products, Raritan Engineering Co.

A flow through system is a tank directly connected to the toilet that treats waste each time the toilet is flushed.          The advantage of Raritan flow through systems is that you are never holding raw sewage and only a limited          amount of treated sewage is discharged each time.  Large discharges of raw sewage, which includes full holding          tanks containing chemicals used to control odor, can be dangerous to the environment. Raritan’s first flow          through system was simply a bottle of household bleach that was injected into the treatment tank each time the          toilet was flushed killing all fecal coliform.            Raritan far exceeds the Federal standard          for waste discharge to help preserve our          waters.  New advancements in flow          through systems work differently but          both Type I devices produced by Raritan          far exceed the federal standard for          discharge which is currently set at fecal          coliform levels of less than 1000 per          100ml. Swimming beaches close when          coliform levels exceed 200 per 100ml and          shellfish beds close when coliform levels          exceed 14 per 100 ml.                                    Both the Purasan and Electroscan discharge at levels lower than 10 per 100ml!               18","Improved design for all toilets and salt, fresh, or brackish                                                      water.
