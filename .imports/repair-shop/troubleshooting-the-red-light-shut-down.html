    <h2>Condition 1</h2>
    <h3>Solid continuous red light</h3>
    Indicates that a fuse has blown or the control board has experienced a fault
    condition. A disruption i.e. loose connection or disconnection in the power
    side of the circuit can result in a &ldquo;continuous red&rdquo; as
    well.Test fuses for continuity and make sure that they are secure in the
    holders (not loose). Check all connections and current carrying wires.
    Tighten all loose connections as needed replace blown fuse(s) if necessary.
    Press the &ldquo;R&rdquo; reset button and then the &ldquo;Push to
    Flush&rdquo; button to restart the system.

    <h2>Condition 2</h2>
    <h3>Slow blinking red light (one blink per second)</h3>
    Indicates that the unit is experiencing low treatment. There is not enough
    electrical current flowing (amperage draw) through the electrode plates by
    virtue of:<br /><br />
    a.) Low salt content in the treatment tank.<br />
    b.) An accumulation of scale (mineral deposits) on the electrode plates.<br />
    c.) Low voltage at the electrode plates. <br />
    d.) Any combination of the above.<br /><br />
    When this light is on the unit may shut down after 5 seconds or run longer
    before shut down occurs. If using a fresh water flush toilet with the 4
    gallon salt feed tank and pump, press the &ldquo;R&rdquo; reset button and
    then the &ldquo;Push to Flush&rdquo; button to restart the system. Repeat as
    necessary unit enough salt is delivered to the treatment tank.

    <h2>Condition 3</h2>
    <h3>A fast blinking red light (2 blinks per second)</h3>
    Indicates that low voltage is being sensed by the system while in the
    treatment mode (both motors and electrodes drawing current). In this case
    the system will shut down after approximately 5 seconds if the voltage is
    less than 10.5 VDC (using a 12VDC system). This is not a system problem.
    Check the power sources, wire size and connections associated with the power
    delivery to the LSTMC (see owners manual).<br /><br />
    To stop the red light, press the &ldquo;R&rdquo; reset button. The unit is
    now ready to be reactivated when proper power is available.
