      >Many installations require the use of a salt feed system. The Lectra/San
      MC, a system that&rsquo;s dependent on salt to operate, may not function

    <br />
    The following examples are intended to assist the installer to match up the
    appropriate salt feed system, however every condition can not be absolute.

    <br /><strong> Condition 1:</strong><br />
    The toilet uses pressurized fresh water to flush with.<br />
    <br /><strong> Condition 2:</strong><br />
    The toilet uses tropical (warm) external ocean water always to flush with,
    but travel to cold waters also. <br />
    <br /><strong> Condition 3:</strong><br />
    The toilet uses tropical (warm) external ocean water always to flush with
    and is not near a tributary (fresh water run off).(none normally
    required)<br />
    <br /><strong> Condition 4:</strong><br />
    The toilet uses external ocean water always to flush with, but we use the
    system in cold waters a large part of the time. <br />
    <br /><strong> Condition 5:</strong><br />
    The toilet uses external ocean water always to flush with, and the water
    temperature is varies.<br />
    <br /><strong> Condition 6:</strong><br />
    The toilet uses tropical (warm) external ocean water always to flush with,
    but sometimes travel to brackish waters.

    <strong>What Does it Do?</strong><br />
    The Lectra/San MC system requires ocean grade salt water in order to process
    properly. If the vessel is operated in brackish, fresh water, cold water or
    the toilet system utilizes on board fresh water to operate, there is a need
    to increase the amount of salt in the flushing water to operable levels that
    will allow the treatment units process to occur. The Lectra/San will not
    function if the amount of salt in the treatment unit is lower than its
    tolerable operating range. This is where the salt feed system becomes a
    necessary addition to the installation.<br />
    <br />
    What are the differences in models? How They Introduce The Salt Solution The
    4 gallon and 2 gallon siphon models use a &ldquo;T&rdquo; check valve in the
    suction line of the toilet (intake water) to dispense a manually adjustable
    amount of saturate salt solution every time the toilet is operated.The 4
    gallon w/pump model incorporates a built in injector pump that dispenses the
    salt solution directly into the treatment unit. This is done only when the
    microprocessor of the treatment unit detects the need for additional
    solution.<br />
    <br /><strong> How are they refilled?</strong><br />
    The 2 gallon model must be manually refilled with a pre made salt solution.
    Estimated flushes before adding salt solution 10 &ndash; 25. (<a

      >2 gallon installation guide</a
    >)<br />
    <br />
    Both of the 4 gallon models are connected to an onboard pressurized water
    source that automatically maintains the water level in the salt tank by the
    use of a float valve. This method allows salt crystals to be added directly
    to the salt tanks without the use of external manual mixing. Estimated
    flushes before adding salt crystals 50 -200.<br />

    <br /><strong>
      Note: Manually adding salt solution directly in the bowl can be
      accomplished although it can be laborious. Adding salt to some
      manufactures toilet(s) is not recommended and, can cause damage to the
      toilet (check with toilets operating instructions or contact the
      manufacture).
