  Raritan made a choice over 50 years ago to produce a longer lasting water
  heater rather than a cheaper water heater. When it comes to materials the
  glass lined tank simply outlasts any other material that is used for water
  heater tanks. Many customers ask why we don&rsquo;t offer a square tank but
  even inside the square tanks is a round tank. Most boats need all the space
  they can get so it does not seem to make sense taking up space with a square
  box around a round tank. Raritan&rsquo;s water heater was originally designed
  with regular fiberglass insulation and a metal jacket.

  It was not uncommon for the jacket and outer part of the tank to rust while
  the glass lined inside remained strong and viable for well over 30 years. In
  the late 80&rsquo;s, early 1990&rsquo;s Raritan changed over to a closed cell
  foam that will not absorb moisture and helps the tank to retain heat much
  longer than the original fiberglass lining. Another notable change was
  developing a plastic out jacket that would not rust.

  Raritan offers the option of 120V or 240V operation as well as a heat
  exchanger. The heat exchanger option can no longer be added at a later time,
  it must be ordered at the time of purchase. Unlike many water heaters that
  have single or double tubes that stick into the tank Raritan offers a heat
  exchanger that is coiled throughout the tank which gives the heating coil
  incredible surface capacity to heat water quickly while underway.
