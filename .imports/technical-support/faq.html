<h3>1. What is Vortex-Vac technology?</h3>

<p>
  There are several ways to create a vacuum in a toilet. A traditional vacuum
  toilet utilizes a stored vacuum created by a positive displacement pump. Such
  systems require vacuum tanks and external pumps and controls.
</p>

<p>
  Raritan&#39;s Vortex-Vac creates its vacuum by using the vortex pump mounted
  inside the bowl. This creates an on-demand instantaneous vacuum and eliminates
  the need for external vacuum pumps, tanks, foot pedal and other mechanical
  components that can fail. This results in a system that is easier to install
  and maintain with significant cost savings.
</p>

<p>
  Our Vortex-Vac flushing technology is also the quietest and most efficient in
  its class. Its low water usage also extends the useful capacity of your
  holding tank.
</p>

<h3>
  2. What is the difference in the various controls offered for Atlantes
  Vortex-Vac?
</h3>

<p>
  Smart Handle- This is the most popular control for this head and was designed
  to match flushing efficiency with low water usage. Simply pull the handle
  forward for one second and release. An automatic sequence will flush the
  toilet. Push and hold the handle backwards and the bowl will empty. The flush
  sequence is fully programmable.
</p>

<p>
  A convenient control box is included for simple wiring. This controls also
  easily interfaces with our patented Sea Fresh option or any of our TYPE I
  waste treatment systems.
</p>

<p>
  Momentary Flush Handle- This model is an alternative to our automatic Smart
  Handle control. Pull and hold the handle forward to add water and push and
  hold to empty. The flush is NOT automatic and will only activate as long as
  the handle is held.
</p>

<p>
  Smart Toilet Control: This is our most popular wall mounted control. This
  fully programmable control was designed to match flushing efficiency with low
  water usage. Our Smart Toilet Control consists of 4 buttons: Normal, Water
  Saver, Fill and Empty. The Normal and Water Saver buttons are automatic and
  will start a sequential flush cycle when activated. The Fill and Empty buttons
  are momentary and function for as long as the button is held. This control can
  also be integrated with a Holding Tank Full sensor to warn the user when their
  holding tank is full.
</p>

<p>
  A convenient control box is included for simple wiring. This controls also
  easily interfaces with our patented Sea Fresh option or any of our TYPE I
  waste treatment systems.
</p>

<h3>3. The toilet flushes poorly or not at all.</h3>

<p>
  The most common cause to poor discharge is a clogged sanitation line. We
  recommend isolating the toilet from the plumbing system by connecting a
  separate piece of hose to the toilet discharge and flushing into a bucket. If
  the toilet flushes fine, you either have an obstruction in the sanitation
  line, Y-valve, vented loop, vent line or sea cock. If the toilet continues to
  perform poorly, refer to the owners guide for further troubleshooting.
</p>

<h3>4. Dirty water comes back in the bowl after a flush.</h3>

<p>
  The most common cause of back flow is Joker Valve wear. Replacement Joker
  valve for all Atlantes except the Vortex-Vac is part# C254. Vortex-Vac models
  use two of part# 221135 (It is recommended both be replaced at the same time).
</p>

<h3>5. No water remains in the bowl after the cycle, why not?</h3>

<p>
  Raritan toilets are not designed to hold water unless a vented loop is
  installed in the discharge line with the top of the loop generally 4 inches
  higher than the top of the bowl. See the specific toilets installation manual
  for specifications and loop height limitations.
</p>

<p>
  Due to plumbing variations, the loop inside the Atlantes Vortex-Vac may not
  retain water and an external vented loop may be required.
</p>

<p>
  If a vented loop is installed (inside or otherwise), check for clogged vent. A
  clogged vent will cause water to siphon out of the bowl giving the empty bowl
  appearance.
</p>

<h3>
  6. My toilet works but smells, what&#39;s wrong with it and how do I get rid
  of the odors?
</h3>

<p>
  The most common source of odor is almost never associated with the toilet
  itself. Odor is typically caused by one of three factors and can be
  distinguished by the smell itself (rotten egg versus waste):
</p>

<p>
  Raw water: Toilets that use raw water often draw in varying forms of marine
  life and vegetation which become trapped in the bowl rim or lay stagnant in
  the incoming feed line. As these items decay, the result is sulfurous malodor
  &ndash; also known as the &quot;rotten egg smell&quot;. One common solution,
  albeit the most expensive, is to convert the toilet to utilize your on-board
  pressurized fresh water supply. Raritan offers both complete new fresh water
  flushing toilets as well as conversion kits for existing raw water flushing
  heads. If converting is not practical, then we recommend the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Install and regularly maintain a good quality in-line strainer. We supply a
    version that is made of a clear, durable polycarbonate that features a
    convenient mounting flange. Part# is 163000.
  </li>
  <li>
    Thoroughly clean the bowl rim and clean/replace all existing supply lines to
    the toilet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, we attack the odor from its source. We recommend installing our
    Knock Out odors kit (part# KO2). This product will introduce a bacteria into
    the intake water line that will prevent the growth of the bacteria that
    cause the rotten egg smell. It will not only eliminate the growth of bad
    bacteria but it will also clean the head as well.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Holding Tank- If the odor you are experiencing smells more like waste rather
  than rotten eggs, the odor is likely coming from your holding tank. You will
  find several items on the market that will work to cover up this odor (e.g.
  formaldehyde based chemicals, vent filters, etc&hellip;). Raritan recommends
  our Kills Odor product (K.O.) which works to eliminate the odor at its source.
  K.O. utilizes live odor-killing bacteria which digests liquids, solid waste
  and paper, totally emulsifying them so there&rsquo;s no need to add
  &quot;tissue digesters&quot; or other &quot;boosters&quot; to your system. The
  bacteria in K.O. neutralize the odor-causing elements in waste, effectively
  converting the contents of your holding tank to an odor-free product. Four
  ounces per 25 gallons of capacity is all you need, and there&rsquo;s seldom
  any need to add K.O. between pump-outs; or need to pump out until the tank is
  full, making K.O. less expensive to use than lower-priced products.
</p>

<p>
  Sanitation Hose-Poor quality and/or improperly routed sanitation hose will
  eventually permeate your sanitation hose. The only solution for permeated hose
  is replacement. If you suspect your hose may be permeated, wet a rag as hot as
  possible and wrap it around the suspect hose. After it cools, remove and smell
  the rag. If the odor has transferred to the rag, the hose is permeated and
  replacement is necessary. Raritan offers our Saniflex sanitation line which is
  made with a butyl rubber to resist permeation and is backed with a 5 year
  warranty. Its flexibility is unmatched in the market place and heating of the
  hose to install fittings is not necessary. Part number is SFH for 1.5&quot;
  and SFH1 for 1&quot; I.D. hose.
</p>

<p>
  Note: it is always recommended to route hoses to gravitate downhill and use
  sweep ells rather than 90 degree fittings to make bends if needed. Avoid any
  dips and sags in the lines so waste cannot settle and collect and cause
  premature failure of your sanitation line. Any loops in the hose must also be
  properly vented.
</p>

<h3>7. What can I use to clean my toilet:</h3>

<p>
  Raritan only recommends our Cleans Potties product (part# 1PCP22) C.P. was the
  first bowl cleaner of its kind to combine a specialized strain of bacteria
  with 100% biodegradable cleaning agent. This bio active formula effectively
  breaks down waste while also leaving the toilet fresh and clean. Other market
  cleaners may contain pine oil, formaldehyde, chlorine, phosphoric acid or
  other solvent or petroleum based products that can damage plastic and rubber
  parts within the head.
</p>

<h3>8. How do I winterize my toilet?</h3>

<p>Refer to detail winterizing instructions in owner&#39;s manual.</p>

<h3>9. What discharge hose size do you recommend?</h3>

<p>
  Our toilets are designed to perform well using either 1&quot; or 1
  &frac12;&quot; I.D. hose. We do however suggest 1 1/2&quot; hose be used in
  salt water applications due to calcium deposition. A smaller diameter hose
  will obstruct more quickly in these conditions and adversely affect the
  performance of your toilet.
</p>

<h3>10. Do I need to cut the discharge fitting on my Vortex-Vac toilet?</h3>

<p>
  No. The discharge fitting was designed to accept both 1&quot; and 1
  &frac12;&quot; I.D. discharge hoses. Modification for 1 &frac12;&quot;
  installations is not necessary and will not adversely affect performance.
</p>

<h3>
  11. The discharge fitting points downwards. Can I plumb this to go through the
  wall rather than down through the floor?
</h3>

<p>
  Yes. We offer two kits to redirect the discharge hose 90 degrees out the back.
  Part #221147 is for 1 &frac12;&quot; I.D. hose and 221148 is for 1&quot; I.D.
  hose.
</p>

<h3>12. How do I identify my Atlantes model series?</h3>

<p>
  If your handle is chrome plated zinc and points upwards, your model is our A-
  series.
</p>

<p>
  If your handle is plastic or the vertically mounted wall switch is blue and
  says &quot;Atlantes&quot;, your model is A5/A6
</p>

<p>
  If your handle is stainless steel and points downwards, or your vertically
  mounted wall switch is blue and says &quot;Toilet Flush Control&quot;, your
  model is A7/A8.
</p>

<p>
  If your handle is stainless steel and points downwards or the wall panel
  mounts horizontally, your model is the AV model. Note: most models flush in
  sequence rather than continuous.
</p>

<h3>13. Can I upgrade older model Atlantes controls to latest controls?</h3>

<p>
  Following is the list of upgrade kits available for older model Atlantes:<br />
  A model _no upgrade available<br />
  A5/A6 model &ndash; upgrade to wall mount Smart Toilet Control Part# STCA6RFK
</p>

<h3>
  14. What kind of holding tank sensors can be used with the Atlantes Vortex Vac
  models?
</h3>

<p>
  Raritan manufactures two holding tank full tank sensors that can directly
  interface with this toilet:<br />
  1. Float type: This sensor can be installed in your tank cap. Part # STCFL<br />
  2. SensaTank: This sensor can be glued to the external side of a plastic or
  fiberglass tank less than 3/8&quot; thick. Part# STCTSA
</p>

<h3>
  15. My A5 Series Atlantes has water still coming into the bowl for a few
  seconds after the discharge pump has shut off. Too much water remains in the
  bowl. What can I do?
</h3>

<p>
  Check jumper setting on control board. Jumper J1 on the Atlantes control board
  must be moved to position B. This will cause both pumps to stop at the same
  time.
</p>

<h3>
  16. Can a tank monitor made by a different company be used with the Atlantes
  Vortex Vac models?
</h3>

<p>
  Raritan has two kind of full tank sensor for easy installation. Interfacing
  other sensor although possible but is not recommended as Raritan control
  boards are designed to work with Raritan sensors.
</p>

<h3>17 What is the amp rating on part AM06012, continuous duty solenoid?</h3>

<p>The amp rating for the contacts is 80 amp and the coil is 1 amp.</p>

<h3>1. How do you winterize a holding tank containing KO?</h3>

<p>
  Adding antifreeze to holding tank that has K.O. will not have any adverse
  effect except K.O. is not effective with antifreeze. While re-commissioning in
  spring, make sure to dilute all contents of holding tank and pump out so that
  antifreeze is removed before starting the use of K.O.
</p>

<h3>2. Is C.H. Cleans Hoses able to be used in aluminum holding tanks?</h3>

<p>Yes, C.H. is safe to use on systems with Aluminum tank</p>

<h3>
  3. Will the ElectroScan/PuraSanEX processed waste have from holding tank
  treated with K.O. without any adverse reaction?
</h3>

<p>
  Yes electroscan and Purasan both have no adverse reaction to K.O. in the
  system.
</p>

<h3>4. How does KO work?</h3>

<p>
  K.O. has spores that comes alive when in contact with organic matter (such as
  sewage). Bacteria multiply in aerobic environment and clean up sewage
  producing carbon di oxide which is odor less. They are bio-system very
  effective in removing source of odors.
</p>

<h3>5. Does KO have shelf life?</h3>

<p>
  KO works in half lives. When it is first produced, it will be 100% effective
  for one year. After two years is be half as effective and so on. It is
  recommend to rotate not store for long periods of time to maximize product
  benefits.
</p>

<h2 id="compact">Compact/Compact II</h2>

<h3>1. What improvements does the Compact II have over the older Compact?</h3>

<p>
  The major improvement is that the intake hose connects at the rear of the pump
  rather than the front, for a cleaner, more streamlined appearance. The Compact
  II has a &quot;T&quot; shaped handle for a better grip, and the Compact II
  pump has slightly more capacity than on the Compact.
</p>

<h3>2. How do I winterize my Compact or Compact II head?</h3>

<p>Refer to winterizing instructions in owner&#39;s manual.</p>

<h3>3. No water stands in the bowl, why not?</h3>

<p>
  Raritan toilets are not by themselves designed to hold water unless a vented
  loop is installed in the discharge line with the top of the loop generally 4
  inches higher than the top of the bowl. The higher the loop the more water
  will remain after each flush. See the specific toilets installation manual for
  specifications and loop height limitations.
</p>

<p>
  Note: Vented loops may need to be installed higher for safety reasons (see
  installation manual for further detail).
</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<hr />
<h2 id="crownhead">Crown Head</h2>

<h3>1. How much power does the Crown Head use?</h3>

<p>
  The current Crown Head centrifugal discharge series draws 36 amps @12 VDC, 20
  amps @24 VDC, 15 amps @32 VDC.
</p>

<p>Note that normal operation is only 8-15 seconds per flush.</p>

<h3>
  2. Is the centrifugal discharge series Crown Head quieter than earlier units?
</h3>

<p>
  Yes. The permanent magnet models of the centrifugal discharge series are
  quieter than previous units that utilize wound field motors. Also both the
  intake and the discharge pump were upgraded to operate at a lower sound level
  while improving the performance and using less power.
</p>

<h3>3. Can an older model Standard Crown Head be used with Lectra/San?</h3>

<p>
  No, it is not recommended, however you may exchange a standard model for a
  factory remanufactured CD-Series Crown Head lower unit.
</p>

<h3>4. Is the Crown Head available with a bigger bowl and seat?</h3>

<p>
  The Crown Head is available with two bowl and seat sizes:<br />
  <br />
  1) Standard marine/RV size, identified by a round bowl.<br />
  2) Hi-boy (household size), identified by an oval bowl.
</p>

<p>
  The standard bowl and seat may be upgraded to the Hi-boy size, contact Raritan
  Technical Support for details. Bowls are interchangeable.
</p>

<h3>
  5. Crown Head suddenly will not pump out solids or paper. What&#39;s wrong?
</h3>

<p>
  In units manufactured after late 1985, problem is usually CH120 discharge pump
  wall. Replacing it should restore the head to proper operation. Older,
  pre-late 1985 units (usually deep draft models) were very voltage-sensitive.
  If batteries aren&#39;t in excellent condition, or if corrosion exists at wire
  joints and terminals - voltage drop may cause head to run slow and not
  discharge properly. Also, CH119D1 discharge impeller may require replacement.
</p>

<h3>
  6. How do I install a replacement discharge pump wall (CH120)? Do you have
  instructions? It is too big to fit inside the housing.
</h3>

<p>
  Instructions are available, literature #L290. Contact Customer Service. CH120
  snaps into a groove behind the macerating teeth inside the housing. Bend it,
  stuff it in, and then snap into position.
</p>

<h3>
  7. My Crown Head won&#39;t bring in enough water to flush. What&#39;s wrong?
</h3>

<p>
  1.) Be sure intake sea cock is fully open and that through hull fitting is not
  clogged (barnacles, etc.) and that strainer is clean, then do the
  following:<br />
  2.) Intake check ball may be stuck or have debris caught in it. Remove intake
  hose and pump plug (CH5VW), and poke eraser end of pencil into the intake
  nozzle to free up check ball and clean out any debris, reconnect the hose and
  plug and test.<br />
  3.) Inlet pump impeller (G13W) may be bad or have taken &quot;set&quot;.
  Remove and examine it; if the vanes are bent in one direction replace it. Also
  check inner pump cavity for scoring and indications that pump has run dry. If
  inside of pump cavity is black and rough, replace pump housing (CH2 or CH2A).
</p>

<h3>8. My Crown Head is noisy; what do I do about it?</h3>

<p>
  Older standard and deep draft models were very audible due to their design.
  These can be exchanged for newer Centrifugal Discharge Series models which are
  quieter.
</p>

<h3>9. How can I convert my Crown Head to pressurized fresh water flush?</h3>

<p>
  1) Remove hose at rear of head, going from intake pump to bowl elbow. Open
  intake pump and remove pump impeller. Replace pump cover.
</p>

<p>
  2) Purchase a nominal 1/2&quot; electrically operated solenoid valve (Raritan
  part #CWPS or equivalent) in the same operating voltage as the Crown Head.
  Mount the solenoid valve to the bowl elbow, using two short plastic pipe
  nipples, a short length of 3/4&quot; hose and hose clamps. Connect the two
  wires from the solenoid valve to the two electrical motor lugs on the Crown
  Head, so that valve opens when head runs and closes when head stops.
</p>

<p>
  3). Purchase a nominal 1/2&quot; vacuum break (anti-siphon valve), WATTS #288A
  or equivalent. Loop the pressure water supply line at least 12&quot; higher
  than the top of the toilet bowl and install the vacuum break at the top of
  this loop, using plastic pipe nipples and hose clamps. The direction of flow
  arrows should point toward the head.
</p>

<p>
  4) Purchase a nominal 1/2&quot; shutoff valve, either globe valve or ball
  valve and install in the water supply line between the water source and the
  vacuum break, using plastic nipples and hose clamping. This will allow you to
  regulate the water flow into the bowl, and also to shut off the water for
  servicing, etc.
</p>

<h3>
  10. Water backs up into the deodorant tank, causing it to overflow. What can I
  do?
</h3>

<p>
  Disassemble and clean the in-line check valve (CH37E). Reinstall, being sure
  the arrow points toward the toilet and not toward the deodorant tank. If
  problem persists, replace the check valve, again being sure that arrow points
  to the toilet and not toward the deodorant tank.
</p>

<h3>11. How do I winterize my Crown Head?</h3>

<p>
  Refer to winterizing instructions in Owner&#39;s Manual.
  (http://www.raritaneng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/L91v0116vCrownHeadOM.pdf)
</p>

<h3>12. No water stands in the bowl, why not?</h3>

<p>
  Raritan toilets are not by themselves designed to hold water unless a vented
  loop is installed in the discharge line with the top of the loop generally 4
  inches higher than the top of the bowl. The higher the loop the more water
  will remain after each flush. See the specific toilets installation manual for
  specifications and loop height limitations.

</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>

<h2>Crown Head II</h2>

<h3>1. What is the difference between the Crown Head II and the Atlantes?</h3>

<p>
  The Atlantes is an all-ceramic unit with the mechanism contained within the
  confines of the bowl. The Crown Head II has a molded plastic cover over the
  macerator and discharge pump at the bottom of the head. Additionally it uses a
  remote-mounted intake pump or solenoid valve, usually mounted below deck. Both
  units contain a built in macerator.
</p>

<h3>2. What is the noise level of the Crown Head II?</h3>

<p>
  The discharge pump and macerator, situated directly beneath the bowl are very
  quiet, comparable to a home toilet. The intake pump is somewhat noisier but is
  remotely mounted, usually below deck. Freshwater flush models are virtually
  noise free. All CHII models are significantly quieter than Crown Head original
  series.
</p>

<h3>3. What is the difference between the Crown Head II and the Crown Head?</h3>

<p>
  The major difference between the two is that the intake pump on the rear of
  the Crown Head has been removed, mounted on its own motor and mounted
  remotely.
</p>

<p>The discharge pump and macerator are the same.</p>

<p>
  A minor difference is the appearance: The Crown Head II uses a streamlined
  lower cover or skirt, whereas the Crown Head uses a square lower cover.
</p>

<p>
  The Crown Head has a built-in deodorant siphon system, the Crown Head II does
  not - it requires the addition of Raritan&#39;s optional Toilet Water Kit
  (TWK) if this feature is desired.
</p>

<p>
  The Crown Head II has available, as an option, a deluxe control system that
  allows timed flush, momentary flush or dry bowl flush, as desired. The Crown
  Head may only be configured for momentary or timed flush - no dry bowl flush
  is available.
</p>

<h3>4. How do I winterize my Crown Head II?</h3>

<p>
  Refer to winterizing instructions in Owner&#39;s Manual.
  (http://www.raritaneng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/L339v0816CHIIvOM.pdf)

<hr />
<h2 id="electroscan">Electroscan/Lectrasan</h2>

<h3>1. Is the Electroscan/LectraSan legal to use?</h3>

<p>
  Yes and No. The Electroscan and LectraSan systems are U.S. Coast Guard
  certified Type I waste treatment systems that are permitted on uninspected
  vessels less than 65 feet and may be used in most areas navigable waterways
  with an in and out tidal flow within the 3 mile limit (9 miles in the Gulf of
  Mexico). There are areas however that are federally designated No-Discharge
  Zones (NDZ&rsquo;s) where its use is not permitted. Please see the EPA&rsquo;s
  website for no discharge zones for a state by state listing.
</p>

<h3>2. How does the Electroscan/LectraSan work?</h3>

<p>
  The Electroscan/LectraSan uses salt water, electricity and a specially
  designed electrode plate to create a powerful bactericide to disinfect waste.
  Each time the toilet is flushed, an equal amount of previously treated waste
  is pushed through the treatment tank and discharged overboard. During this
  process, the first chamber macerates to reduce particle size and the second
  chamber mixes to ensure uniform treatment of contents. When first activated,
  the user has 35 seconds to flush toilet. After that, the electrode is
  energized for approximately 2 minutes. During this time, the powerful
  bactericide is generated in both chambers.to disinfect waste.
</p>

<h3>3. How much salt do I need to add to my Electroscan/LectraSan system?</h3>

<p>
  The Electroscan/LectraSan operates on the premise ocean water salinity (3.5%)
  is available. This percentage can vary depending on area and tidal changes as
  well as other factors including age, temperature, wear to name a few. In
  short, the system will indicate an error if treatment is not adequate. If an
  error exists, please refer to the troubleshooting guide of the owner&rsquo;s
  guide.
</p>

<h3>4. What type of salt do I add if needed?</h3>

<p>
  We recommend what is commonly referred to as &quot;Solar Salt&quot; or
  &quot;Water Softener Salt&quot;. This type if salt is readily available in
  pellet form from many local hardware stores. Refer to the owner&rsquo;s guide
  for application instructions.
</p>

<h3>
  5. Can I use a freshwater flush toilet with this model? If so what do I need?
</h3>

<p>
  Yes. You will need one of our salt feed units that will bring your flush water
  to seawater salinity as seawater. You may also manually add a few ounces of
  granulated salt to a Raritan toilet bowl before each flush. Do not add salt to
  non-Raritan toilets without checking with manufacturer.
</p>

<h3>6. Can I install my Electroscan further than 6 feet from the head?</h3>

<p>
  Yes. Raritan recommends the Electroscan be 6 feet or less from the head. This
  will insure that the materials that are flushed from the toilet actually make
  it into the Electroscan and are not residing in the connecting hose between
  the two, where they can putrefy and cause odor problems. If hose is more than
  6 feet, odor free hose such as SaniFlex is recommended.
</p>

<h3>7. Can I install an Electroscan higher than the toilet?</h3>

<p>
  Yes. To prevent back flow from Electroscan to toilet, a vented loop slightly
  higher than Electroscan&rsquo;s highest point is required.
</p>

<h3>8. Can I use antifreeze to winterize my treatment system?</h3>

<p>
  No. Under no circumstances may antifreeze be used in a Raritan treatment
  system. We recommend the tank be pumped dry. Refer to the owner&rsquo;s manual
  for more information.
</p>

<h3>9. Do I need to clean or do any maintenance to my Electroscan?</h3>

<p>
  Yes, refer to the owner&rsquo;s manual for Electroscan clean out and storage
  procedures.
</p>

<h3>10. How often do I turn on my treatment system?</h3>

<p>
  The Electroscan (all series) is intended to be operated with each flush of the
  toilet. Failure to do this will result in eventual clogging and possible
  damage to the unit.
</p>

<h3>11. I have 2 heads, one fore and one aft, can I use one Electroscan?</h3>

<p>
  Yes, Electroscan controls are designed for use with two toilets. Distance from
  toilet discharge to treatment tank on Electroscan should be maximum of 6 feet.
  If this distance is more than 6 feet we recommend use of our Sani/flex hose to
  reduce odors as untreated sewage will be sitting in the hose for longer run of
  hose.
</p>

<h3>12. Electroscan MC/EC - Can I use the Electroscan with my head?</h3>

<p>
  Probably. The Electroscan system will work with most installed heads that have
  positive displacement pumps discharging the waste from the head. It will not
  work with recirculating heads, portable type heads, Jet style and heads with
  built-in holding tanks. For specific details, contact Raritan Technical
  Support.
</p>

<h3>
  13. Lectra/San EC - My check fuse light is on but the 3 fuses check O.K., what
  is the problem?
</h3>

<p>
  Check available voltage at treatment system while it is running in the second
  cycle - must be no less than 11.5 VDC. Low voltage will cause the check fuse
  light to come on. If voltage checks O.K., problem is likely in the control
  board mounted on the Lectra/San EC treatment unit. Replace control board.
</p>

<h3>14. Lectra/San EC - My low salt light is always on, why?</h3>

<p>
  Be sure that adequate salt is in the water supplied to the Lectra/San. Check
  that salt feed system (if used) is filled and operating correctly. Check that
  electrodes are clean. Check available voltage at treatment system while it is
  running in the second cycle - must be no less than 11.5 VDC.
</p>

<h3>15. Can an Electroscan be used with a vacuum toilet?</h3>

<p>Yes, for details see application note.</p>

<h3>16. How do I winterize my Electroscan?</h3>

<p>
  Refer to winterizing instructions in Owner&#39;s Manual.
  (http://raritaneng.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/L3400514-EST.pdf)
</p>

<h3>17. I have your Lectra/San Toilet (head) and need parts.</h3>

<p>
  The Lectra/San is not a toilet (head). The Lectra/ San is a Type I MSD (Waste
  Treatment System) that the toilet discharges into. To find out what type of
  toilet you have check how to identify the toilet then refer to your
  owner&rsquo;s manual for part information.
</p>

<h3>18. How long does a typical electrode last?</h3>

<p>
  Life of electrode will reduce due to several factors:<br />
  <br />
  1. Salinity less than sea water salinity reduces life<br />
  2. Cold water less than 50 degree F reduces life.<br />
  3. Other chemicals in waste system (like toilet cleaners) can form an
  undesirable coating.<br />
  4. Failure to clean electrodes every six months for calcium deposits.
</p>

<p>
  Typically electrode are designed for recreation use (up to 4 people per boat).
  Raritan warranty electrode for one year.

<h2 id="freshhead">Fresh Head</h2>

<h3>1. Can I use fresh head with Sea water?</h3>

<p>
  FRESHHEAD is designed for fresh water inlet flush only to reduce odors. It
  uses minimum water and also helps solve problems associated with calcium
  deposits in discharge hoses and eliminates inlet sea cock.
</p>

<p>
  In case of emergency or if pressurized fresh water is not available , sea or
  fresh water can be added to the bowl manually to pump out waste from bowl.
  Discharge pump can be used to pump out sea water waste.
</p>

<h3>
  2. How do I prevent water filling up in bowl from waste hose when head is not
  used?
</h3>

<p>
  When FRESHHEAD is not in use you can bring flush handle all the way forward
  and turn lever at the bottom of handle toward front to lock handle. This seals
  the discharge port so that no back flow from discharge hose can come back to
  bowl.
</p>

<h3>3. Flow of water in the bowl rim have reduced how can I increase flow?</h3>

<p>
  If you had good flow previously and flow has reduced, check and clean filter
  screen inside inlet valve. To remove screen, disconnect inlet fitting at the
  valve.
</p>

<h3>4. How much water does the Fresh Head use?</h3>

<p>
  The inlet water is controlled by the user pressing down on the inlet valve
  lever.
</p>

<p>Average consumption is 1 pint (.47L) and &frac34; gal (2.8L) for solids.</p>

<h2 id="generalquestions">General Questions</h2>

<h3>1. I have a Raritan head, what type is it?</h3>

<p>
  Go to the Identify Your Head Page for more information regarding the
  identification of your hardware.
</p>

<h3>
  2. My toilet works but smells, what&#39;s wrong with it and how do I get rid
  of the odors?
</h3>

<p>The most common reasons for odors are:</p>

<p>
  Foul marina water being drawn into the toilet bowl from outside. Adding a
  Raritan K.O.2 Kit to your installation and using Raritan K.O. help keep the
  odor level down. Raritan toilets using on board pressurized fresh water have
  no odors.
</p>

<p>
  Improper discharge hose is being used and the hose material has become
  contaminated resulting odor permeation. Replace the hose with thick walled
  sanitation hose that resists odor permeation such as Raritan SaniFlex #SFH.
</p>

<p>
  Improper routing of discharge hose. Horizontal runs and dips or valleys where
  raw sewage may stand must be avoided. Even the best sanitation hose will not
  last long in these cases. Route hoses to gravitate downhill and use sweep ells
  rather than 90&quot; fittings to make bends if needed. Loops in the hose must
  be properly vented.
</p>

<p>
  No water trap in the bottom of the toilet bowl. Adding a vented loop in the
  discharge hose will allow a stand of water to exist in the section of hose
  from the toilet to the vented loop. This also ensures that a certain amount of
  water remains in the bowl after each flush. The height of the loop will
  determine how much water will remain in the bowl. Sewage odor/gas would have
  to be pressurized to force it through the water seal created by the addition
  of the vented loop.
</p>

<p>
  Eel grass, other forms of marine life or vegetation which are drawn into the
  toilet&#39;s flush water may have become trapped in the rim of the bowl. This
  can produce a sulfurous malodor (i.e.: rotten egg smell) as this matter
  decays. If this occurs, the bowl must be flushed out under dock side pressure
  while using a probe inserted into the bowl rim rinsing holes to free any
  lodged debris. All seawater flush toilets must have an inline strainer
  installed in the intake hose to prevent this from happening. Fresh water
  toilets such as Fresh Head or pressurized water electric toilets do not have
  odors by avoiding sea water.
</p>

<h3>
  3. What types of cleaners and deodorizers can I use safely to clean the toilet
  and your sanitation equipment?
</h3>

<p>
  Raritan recommends that only our own products, Raritan C.P. (Clean Potty) be
  used with our marine toilets and the electroscan system. C.P. bio cleaner
  helps to break down waste. To clean the bowl, we recommend Raritan&#39;s C.P.
  Do not use harsh cleansers, and other products which may contain pine oil,
  formaldehyde, chlorine, phosphoric acid or any solvent or petroleum based
  products. These can damage plastic and rubber parts within the head.
</p>

<p>4. No water stands in the bowl, why not?</p>

<p>
  Raritan toilets are not by themselves designed to hold water unless a vented
  loop is installed in the discharge line with the top of the loop generally 4
  inches higher than the top of the bowl. The higher the loop the more water
  will remain after each flush. See the specific toilets installation manual for
  specifications and loop height limitations.
</p>

<p>
  Note: Vented loops may need to be installed higher for safety reasons. See
  installation manual for further details.
</p>

<h3>
  5. I need a new toilet seat and lid but need to know which one to order, how
  do I tell the difference?
</h3>

<p>
  Raise the seat and look at the bowl. If the bowl is round, it is the Standard
  marine/RV size and you will order part #1238SC. If the bowl is oval shaped, it
  is our Hi-boy and you would order part #1245SC. Replacement seats for the
  Atlantes Elongated toilet are part #AL030 (specify color).
</p>

<h3>6. Where can I get my Raritan product repaired?</h3>

<p>
  See sending products for repair.
  (https://raritaneng.com/tech-support/faq/#Repair)
</p>

<h3>7. Can I reduce the discharge to a smaller size?</h3>

<p>See owner&rsquo;s manual section for detailed recommendations.</p>

<h3>8. My manual toilet is hard to pump (downward), what&#39;s my problem?</h3>

<p>
  Check holding tank vent line for clogs - if the air in the holding tank cannot
  escape, it will resist the flow of anything coming into the tank. Check lines,
  fittings, etc. for calcium buildup. Calcium buildup can also occur inside the
  pump bore, and will require removal. Another possibility is a clog of paper,
  paper towels, handy-wipes or feminine products in the joker valve (part #s
  1224 or C253). Close discharge seacock if used, removes discharge fitting
  (part #s 1222AW or 1222B) with discharge hose still attached. Joker valve is
  installed inside the discharge fitting and may be cleaned or replaced when
  accessed.
</p>

<p>
  TIP: have paper towels, rags, etc., available to absorb water, which will flow
  from fitting when removed.
</p>

<h3>
  9. My toilet overflows with sea water when I run at high speeds? How do I
  correct this situation?
</h3>

<p>
  One of the most common issues relates to the type of scoop on your thru hull.
  If the scoop is oriented to &quot;cup&quot; the water when the boat is in
  motion, the water will do as you describe. If you reverse this scoop, it will
  take care of this problem.
</p>

<h3>
  10. Can I use the C254 joker valve instead of the C253 joker valve? (and vice
  versa)
</h3>

<p>
  C253 Joker valve can be used for C254 but C254 joker valve cannot be used for
  C253
</p>

<h3>
  11. What is the difference between ATLANTES and ELEGANCE, which is better and
  why?
</h3>

<p>See selecting toilets</p>

<h3>12. Can I use antifreeze to winterize my treatment system?</h3>

<p>
  Antifreeze is not recommended for Raritan Treatment system, instead we
  recommend dry winterization. See owner&rsquo;s manual for system.
</p>

<h3>
  13. Can I upgrade from a push button switch to another control later on vortex
  vac toilets?
</h3>

<p>Vortex-Vac series toilets can be upgraded to other controls.</p>

<h3>14. What are the differences between Electroscan and Purasan?</h3>

<p>
  Both units may be used in salt water. The Electroscan converts salt water to a
  powerful bactericide that disinfects waste while the Purasan uses a chlorine
  type tablet for disinfection.
</p>

<p>
  The Purasan was designed for those in freshwater areas where the continual
  addition of salt can be cumbersome. In order for the Electroscan to function
  properly in brackish water, adding salt will be needed. This is generally done
  using an automatic salt feed system.
</p>

<h3>
  15. Do I need to cut the 1&quot; portion of my discharge fitting if using 1
  &frac12;&quot; hose? (ME, Atlantes, and SeaEra)
</h3>

<p>
  It not necessary to cut the 1&quot; portion of discharge fitting as waste is
  macerated.
</p>

<h3>
  16. How do I clean my head and what cleaning supplies are available when it
  has a LectraSan or Electroscan in place?
</h3>

<p>
  Raritan only recommends our Cleans Potties product (part# 1PCP22) C.P. was the
  first bowl cleaner of its kind to combine a specialized strain of bacteria
  with 100% biodegradable cleaning agent. This bio active formula effectively
  breaks down waste while also leaving the toilet fresh and clean. Other market
  cleaners may contain pine oil, formaldehyde, chlorine, phosphoric acid or
  other solvent or petroleum based products that can damage plastic and rubber
  parts within the head and are not compatible with LectraSan or Electroscan
</p>

<h3>
  17. How do I convert my current holding tank to a Raritan Hold n&rsquo; Treat
  control?
</h3>

<p>Hold and treat component system</p>

<h3>
  18. I see that you have printable templates for your toilets. Do you have
  toilet templates in other formats for builders and designers?
</h3>

<p>
  We can provide them will full scale 2D drawings, as well as, many of our
  products in 3D format.

<h2 id="marineelegance">Marine Elegance</h2>

<h3>1. What is a Vortex-Vac technology?</h3>

<p>
  There are several ways to create a vacuum in a toilet. A traditional vacuum
  toilet utilizes a stored vacuum created by a positive displacement pump. Such
  systems require vacuum tanks and external pumps and controls.
</p>

<p>
  Raritan&rsquo;s Vortex-Vac creates its vacuum by using the vortex pump mounted
  inside the bowl. This creates an on-demand instantaneous vacuum and eliminates
  the need for external vacuum pumps, tanks, foot pedal and other mechanical
  components that can fail. This results in a system that is easier to install
  and maintain with significant cost savings. Our Vortex-Vac flushing technology
  is also the quietest and most efficient in its class. Its low water usage also
  extends the useful capacity of your holding tank.
</p>

<h3>
  2. What is the difference in the various controls offered for Marine Elegance?
</h3>

<p>Marine Elegance is supplied with one of the following controls:</p>

<p>
  Push Button Control: A heavy duty push button switch activates the toilet
  inlet water and discharge motor simultaneously for as long as the button is
  held. This switch does NOT provide the ability to fill or wet the bowl before
  use or discharge or empty the bowl if desired.
</p>

<p>
  Multi-function Momentary Control: The toilet inlet water and discharge motor
  are controlled separately with two switches. One is used to fill or wet the
  bowl before use and the other is used to discharge or empty the bowl.
</p>

<p>
  Flushing is momentary and must be held for as long as desired. A convenient
  control box is included for simple wiring. This controls also easily
  interfaces with our patented Sea Fresh option or any of our TYPE I waste
  treatment systems. Smart Toilet Control: This is our most popular toilet
  control. This fully programmable control was designed to match flushing
  efficiency with low water usage. Our Smart Toilet Control consists of 4
  buttons: Normal, Water Saver, Fill and Empty. The Normal and Water Saver
  buttons are automatic and will start a sequential flush cycle when activated.
  The Fill and Empty buttons are momentary and function for as long as the
  button is held. This control can also be integrated with a Holding Tank Full
  sensor to warn the user when their holding tank is full.
</p>

<p>
  A convenient control box is included for simple wiring. This controls also
  easily interfaces with our patented Sea Fresh option or any of our TYPE I
  waste treatment systems.
</p>

<h3>3. The toilet flushes poorly or not at all.</h3>

<p>
  The most common cause to poor discharge is a clogged sanitation line. We
  recommend isolating the toilet from the plumbing system by connecting a
  separate piece of hose to the toilet discharge and flushing into a bucket. If
  the toilet flushes fine, you either have an obstruction in the sanitation
  line, Y-valve, vented loop, vent line or sea cock. If the toilet continues to
  perform poorly, refer to the owners guide for further troubleshooting.
</p>

<h3>4. Dirty water comes back in the bowl after a flush.</h3>

<p>
  The most common cause of back flow is Joker Valve wear. Vortex-Vac models use
  two of part# 221135 (It is recommended both be replaced at the same time).
</p>

<h3>5. No water stands in the bowl after the cycle, why not?</h3>

<p>
  Raritan toilets are not designed to hold water unless a vented loop is
  installed in the discharge line with the top of the loop generally 4 inches
  higher than the top of the bowl. The higher the loop the more water will
  remain after each flush. See the specific toilets installation manual for
  specifications and loop height limitations.
</p>

<p>
  Build in loop inside the Vortex Vac Marine Elegance retains water for most
  (but not all) installation. Some installation may need external loop.
</p>

<p>
  If a vented loop is installed (inside or otherwise), check for clogged vent. A
  clogged vent will cause water to siphon out of the bowl.
</p>

<h3>
  6. My toilet works but smells, what&#39;s wrong with it and how do I get rid
  of the odors?
</h3>

<p>
  The most common source of odor is almost never associated with the toilet
  itself. Odor is typically caused by one of three factors and can be
  distinguished by the smell itself (rotten egg versus waste):
</p>

<p>
  Raw water: Toilets that use raw water often draw in varying forms of marine
  life and vegetation which become trapped in the bowl rim or lay stagnant in
  the incoming feed line. As these items decay, the result is sulfurous malodor
  - also known as the &quot;rotten egg smell&quot;. One common solution, albeit
  the most expensive, is to convert the toilet to utilize your on-board
  pressurized fresh water supply. Raritan offers both complete new fresh water
  flushing toilets as well as conversion kits for existing raw water flushing
  heads. If converting is not practical, then we recommend the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Install and regularly maintain a good quality in-line strainer. We supply a
    version that is made of a clear, durable polycarbonate that features a
    convenient mounting flange. Part# is 163000.
  </li>
  <li>
    Thoroughly clean the bowl rim and clean/replace all existing supply lines to
    the toilet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, we attack the odor from its source. We recommend installing our
    Knock Out odors kit (part# KO2). This product will introduce a bacteria into
    the intake water line that will prevent the growth of the bacteria that
    cause the rotten egg smell. It will not only eliminate the growth of bad
    bacteria but it will also clean the head as well.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Holding Tank- If the odor you are experiencing smells more like waste rather
  than rotten eggs, the odor is likely coming from your holding tank. You will
  find several items on the market that will work to cover up this odor (e.g.
  formaldehyde based chemicals, vent filters, etc&hellip;). Raritan recommends
  our Kills Odor product (K.O.) which works to eliminate the odor at its source.
  K.O. utilizes live odor-killing bacteria which digests liquids, solid waste
  and paper, totally emulsifying them so there&rsquo;s no need to add
  &quot;tissue digesters&quot; or other &quot;boosters&quot; to your system. The
  bacteria in K.O. neutralize the odor-causing elements in waste, effectively
  converting the contents of your holding tank to an odor-free product. Four
  ounces per 25 gallons of capacity is all you need, and there&rsquo;s seldom
  any need to add K.O. between pump-outs; or need to pump out until the tank is
  full, making K.O. less expensive to use than lower-priced products.
</p>

<p>
  Sanitation Hose-Poor quality and/or improperly routed sanitation hose will
  eventually permeate your sanitation hose. The only solution for permeated hose
  is replacement. If you suspect your hose may be permeated, wet a rag as hot as
  possible and wrap it around the suspect hose. After it cools, remove and smell
  the rag. If the odor has transferred to the rag, the hose is permeated and
  replacement is necessary. Raritan offers our Saniflex sanitation line which is
  made with a butyl rubber to resist permeation and is backed with a 5 year
  warranty. Its flexibility is unmatched in the market place and heating of the
  hose to install fittings is not necessary. Part number is SFH for 1.5&quot;
  and SFH1 for 1&quot; I.D. hose.
</p>

<p>
  Note: it is always recommended to route hoses to gravitate downhill and use
  sweep ells rather than 90 degree fittings to make bends if needed. Avoid any
  dips and sags in the lines so waste cannot settle and collect and cause
  premature failure of your sanitation line. Any loops in the hose must also be
  properly vented.
</p>

<h3>7. What can I use to clean my toilet:</h3>

<p>
  Raritan only recommends our Cleans Potties product (part# 1PCP22) C.P. was the
  first bowl cleaner of its kind to combine a specialized strain of bacteria
  with 100% biodegradable cleaning agent. This bio active formula effectively
  breaks down waste while also leaving the toilet fresh and clean. Other market
  cleaners may contain pine oil, formaldehyde, chlorine, phosphoric acid or
  other solvent or petroleum based products that can damage plastic and rubber
  parts within the head.
</p>

<h3>8. How do I winterize my toilet?</h3>

<p>
  Refer to detail winterizing instructions in owner&#39;s
  manual.(http://raritaneng.app-x.info/pdf_files/Marine%20Elegance/L460v0610%20Marine%20Elegance%20Manual.pdf)
</p>

<h3>9. What discharge hose size do you recommend?</h3>

<p>
  Our toilets are designed to perform well using either 1&quot; or 1
  &frac12;&quot; I.D. hose. We do however suggest 1 1/2&quot; hose be used in
  salt water applications due to calcium deposition. A smaller diameter hose
  will obstruct more quickly in these conditions and adversely affect the
  performance of your toilet.
</p>

<h3>10. Do I need to cut the discharge fitting on my Vortex-Vac toilet?</h3>

<p>
  No. The discharge fitting was designed to accept both 1&quot; and 1
  &frac12;&quot; I.D. discharge hoses. Modification for 1 &frac12;&quot;
  installations is not necessary and will not adversely affect performance.
</p>

<h3>
  11. The discharge fitting points downwards. Can I plumb this to go through the
  wall rather than down through the floor?
</h3>

<p>
  Yes. We offer two kits to redirect the discharge hose 90 degrees out the back.
  Part #221147 is for 1 &frac12;&quot; I.D. hose and 221148 is for 1&quot; I.D.
  hose
</p>

<h3>
  12. What kind of full tank sensor can be used with the Marine Elegance Vortex
  Vac models?
</h3>

<p>
  Raritan manufactures two holding tank full tank sensors that can directly
  interface with this toilet:
</p>

<p>
  1. Float type: This sensor can be installed in your tank cap. Part # STCFL<br />
  2. SensaTank: This sensor can be glued to the external side of a plastic or
  fiberglass tank less than 3/8&quot; thick. Part# STCTSA
</p>

<h3>13. How do I double clamp the discharge fitting? Is it too short?</h3>

<p>
  The earlier model Marine Elegance toilets had a shorter discharge fitting.
  Current discharge fitting, replacement part # 221145 will allow double clamps.
</p>

<h2 id="phii">PHEII</h2>

<h3>1. The toilet flushes poorly or not at all. Why?</h3>

<p>
  The most common cause to poor discharge is a clogged sanitation line. We
  recommend isolating the toilet from the plumbing system by connecting a
  separate piece of hose to the toilet discharge and flushing into a bucket. If
  the toilet flushes fine, you either have an obstruction in the sanitation
  line, Y-valve, vented loop, vent line or sea cock. If the toilet continues to
  perform poorly we recommend purchasing a full rebuild kit. There are three
  main components within this kit that work together to ensure quality flushing:
  1232MS piston O-ring, 1228CW flapper valve and the C253 joker valve. All three
  of these parts work in unison to create the proper suction to flush the
  toilet. If any one of these wears, it can the cause pump to perform poorly.
</p>

<h3>2. Dirty water comes back in the bowl after a flush.</h3>

<p>
  The most common cause of back flow is Joker Valve wear. Replacement Joker
  valve for all Atlantes except the Vortex-Vac is part# C254. Vortex-Vac models
  use two of part# 221135 (It is recommended both be replaced at the same time).
</p>

<h3>3. No water remains in the bowl after the cycle, why not?</h3>

<p>
  Raritan toilets are not designed to hold water unless a vented loop is
  installed in the discharge line with the top of the loop generally 4 inches
  higher than the top of the bowl. See the specific toilets installation manual
  for specifications and loop height limitations.
</p>

<p>
  If a vented loop is installed (inside or otherwise), check for clogged vent. A
  clogged vent will cause water to siphon out of the bowl giving the empty bowl
  appearance.
</p>

<h3>
  4. My toilet works but smells, what&#39;s wrong with it and how do I get rid
  of the odors?
</h3>

<p>
  The most common source of odor is almost never associated with the toilet
  itself. Odor is typically caused by one of three factors and can be
  distinguished by the smell itself (rotten egg versus waste):
</p>

<p>
  Raw water: Toilets that use raw water often draw in varying forms of marine
  life and vegetation which become trapped in the bowl rim or lay stagnant in
  the incoming feed line. As these items decay, the result is sulfurous malodor
  &ndash; also known as the &quot;rotten egg smell&quot;. One common solution,
  albeit the most expensive, is to convert the toilet to utilize your on-board
  pressurized fresh water supply. Raritan offers both complete new fresh water
  flushing toilets as well as conversion kits for existing raw water flushing
  heads. If converting is not practical, then we recommend the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Install and regularly maintain a good quality in-line strainer. We supply a
    version that is made of a clear, durable polycarbonate that features a
    convenient mounting flange. Part# is 163000.
  </li>
  <li>
    Thoroughly clean the bowl rim and clean/replace all existing supply lines to
    the toilet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, we attack the odor from its source. We recommend installing our
    Knock Out odors kit (part# KO2). This product will introduce a bacteria into
    the intake water line that will prevent the growth of the bacteria that
    cause the rotten egg smell. It will not only eliminate the growth of bad
    bacteria but it will also clean the head as well.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Holding Tank- If the odor you are experiencing smells more like waste rather
  than rotten eggs, the odor is likely coming from your holding tank. You will
  find several items on the market that will work to cover up this odor (e.g.
  formaldehyde based chemicals, vent filters, etc&hellip;). Raritan recommends
  our Kills Odor product (K.O.) which works to eliminate the odor at its source.
  K.O. utilizes live odor-killing bacteria which digests liquids, solid waste
  and paper, totally emulsifying them so there&rsquo;s no need to add
  &quot;tissue digesters&quot; or other &quot;boosters&quot; to your system. The
  bacteria in K.O. neutralize the odor-causing elements in waste, effectively
  converting the contents of your holding tank to an odor-free product. Four
  ounces per 25 gallons of capacity is all you need, and there&rsquo;s seldom
  any need to add K.O. between pump-outs; or need to pump out until the tank is
  full, making K.O. less expensive to use than lower-priced products.
</p>

<p>
  Sanitation Hose-Poor quality and/or improperly routed sanitation hose will
  eventually permeate your sanitation hose. The only solution for permeated hose
  is replacement. If you suspect your hose may be permeated, wet a rag as hot as
  possible and wrap it around the suspect hose. After it cools, remove and smell
  the rag. If the odor has transferred to the rag, the hose is permeated and
  replacement is necessary. Raritan offers our Saniflex sanitation line which is
  made with a butyl rubber to resist permeation and is backed with a 5 year
  warranty. Its flexibility is unmatched in the market place and heating of the
  hose to install fittings is not necessary. Part number is SFH for 1.5&quot;
  and SFH1 for 1&quot; I.D. hose.
</p>

<p>
  Note: it is always recommended to route hoses to gravitate downhill and use
  sweep ells rather than 90 degree fittings to make bends if needed. Avoid any
  dips and sags in the lines so waste cannot settle and collect and cause
  premature failure of your sanitation line. Any loops in the hose must also be
  properly vented.
</p>

<h3>5. What can I use to clean my toilet:</h3>

<p>
  Raritan only recommends our Cleans Potties product (part# 1PCP22) C.P. was the
  first bowl cleaner of its kind to combine a specialized strain of bacteria
  with 100% biodegradable cleaning agent. This bio active formula effectively
  breaks down waste while also leaving the toilet fresh and clean. Other market
  cleaners may contain pine oil, formaldehyde, chlorine, phosphoric acid or
  other solvent or petroleum based products that can damage plastic and rubber
  parts within the head.
</p>

<h3>6. Why does the pump move and flex when it is pumped?</h3>

<p>
  This is normal operation. The drive motor and the pump are not on the same
  centerline. Therefore the force vector is at an angle between the drive motor
  ant the center of the pump, causing some side movement. Under normal
  situations it poses no problem.
</p>

<h3>
  7. The toilet makes grinding and squealing sounds when it is running;
  what&#39;s wrong?
</h3>

<p>
  This was most common on the PHII/PHEII units that were manufactured before the
  cartridge seal pump series (1200C). In the early electric drive units, the
  drive arm squeaked against the pump housing regardless of how much grease was
  applied. The cure is to convert to the 1116BW drive arm kit - the material has
  been changed in the drive arm to one that is compatible with the material of
  the pump housing. In manual units, the most common source for squeaking is the
  bushing area just beneath the seal. As the piston rod pumps up and down, the
  rod squeaks against the bushing area. The cure for this is to put SuperLube on
  the piston shaft; we also recommend a TWK( Toilet Water Kit).
</p>

<p>
  Another area for squeaking is when the bushing area wears and the corners of
  the piston scrape against the cylinder bore. Sometimes vegetable oil put into
  the toilet bowl will stop the squeak temporarily.
</p>

<p>For a permanent cure, the pump housing must be updated to the 1200CW.</p>

<h3>8. Which type of SuperLube is recommended for PHII units?</h3>

<p>
  Silicone Lubricating Grease with Syncolon&reg; (PTFE) by Super Lube is
  recommended.
</p>

<h3>
  9. What tool or method is needed to remove the 1249 plug to clean out the
  base?
</h3>

<p>
  Insert (2) 1/4 bolts 180 degrees from each other into the 1249 plug. Use a
  file or screwdriver as leverage to remove the plug for leverage to unscrew.
</p>

<h3>10. How do I winterize my PHEII marine toilet?</h3>

<p>
  Refer to winterizing instructions in owner&#39;s
  manual.(http://www.raritaneng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/L04v1215PHIIPHEIIOM.pdf)
</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="phc">PHII and PHC</h2>

<p>
  1. The toilet flushes poorly or not at all. The most common cause to poor
  discharge is a clogged sanitation line. We recommend isolating the toilet from
  the plumbing system by connecting a separate piece of hose to the toilet
  discharge and flushing into a bucket. If the toilet flushes fine, you either
  have an obstruction in the sanitation line, Y-valve, vented loop, vent line or
  sea cock.
</p>

<p>
  If the toilet continues to perform poorly we recommend purchasing a full
  rebuild kit. There are three main components within this kit that work
  together to ensure quality flushing: 1232MS piston O-ring, 1228CW flapper
  valve and the C253 joker valve. All three of these parts work in unison to
  create the proper suction to flush the toilet. If any one of these wears, it
  can the cause pump to perform poorly.
</p>

<h3>2. Dirty water comes back in the bowl after a flush.</h3>

<p>
  The most common cause of back flow is Joker Valve wear. Replace with part#
  C253
</p>

<h3>
  3. I wish to order a repair kit but don&#39;t know which one I need; how do I
  identify which one I need?
</h3>

<p>
  Units manufactured prior to 1981 are identified by a chromed shutoff valve
  handle on the front of the toilet pump; this is the PH series and uses repair
  kit #PHRK.
</p>

<p>
  Units manufactured 1981 - June, 1992 are identified by a plastic on-off knob
  at the front of the toilet pump and a pump shaft seal held in place by a star
  washer-type snap ring. This is the original PHII series and uses repair kit
  #PHRKII.
</p>

<p>
  The current series (6/92 - present) is identified by a cartridge-type pump
  shaft seal with a hex nut at the top of the pump housing where the piston
  shaft goes through. This unit uses repair kit #PHRKIIC.
</p>

<h3>4. No water remains in the bowl after a flush, why not?</h3>

<p>
  Raritan toilets are not designed to hold water unless a vented loop is
  installed in the discharge line with the top of the loop generally 4 inches
  higher than the top of the bowl. The higher the loop the more water will
  remain after each flush. See the specific toilets installation manual for
  specifications and loop height limitations.
</p>

<p>
  If a vented loop is installed, check for clogged vent. A clogged vent will
  cause water to siphon out of the bowl.
</p>

<h3>5. The lever is very hard to push down. What&rsquo;s wrong?</h3>

<p>
  If the head pumps when in the flush position but is hard to pump when in dry
  mode, replace part# 1203W. This valve is designed to let air in while dry
  pumping. This valve is likely stuck in the closed position.
</p>

<p>
  If the pump handle is hard to push in both modes, check for restriction in the
  discharge line or a clogged vent. This back pressure is the likely cause to
  hard pumping.
</p>

<h3>6. The pump squeaks when I pump it, what&#39;s wrong?</h3>

<p>
  This was most common on the PHII/PHEII units that were manufactured before the
  cartridge seal pump series (1200C).
</p>

<p>
  In the early electric drive units, the drive arm squeaked against the pump
  housing regardless of how much grease was applied. The cure is to convert to
  the 1116BW drive arm kit - the material has been changed in the drive arm to
  one that is compatible with the material of the pump housing. In manual units,
  the most common source for squeaking is the bushing area just beneath the
  seal. As the piston rod pumps up and down, the rod squeaks against the bushing
  area. The cure for this is to put SuperLube on the piston shaft; we also
  recommend a TWK.
</p>

<p>
  Another area for squeaking is when the bushing area wears and the corners of
  the piston scrape against the cylinder bore. Sometimes vegetable oil put into
  the toilet bowl will stop the squeak temporarily. For a permanent cure, the
  pump housing must be updated to the 1200CW.
</p>

<h3>
  7. I&#39;ve replaced my piston shaft seal and it still leaks, what is the
  problem
</h3>

<p>
  Usually the problem is a worn bushing area in the 1200B pump housing, which
  would necessitate replacing the pump housing with a 1200CW.
</p>

<p>
  A possible lesser problem would be that the replacement seal wasn&#39;t
  installed correctly. It is installed with the flat side up, plastic washer on
  top of it and snap ring installed with curved surface down. Using the manual
  handle to install the snap ring, press it until it just contacts the white
  washer, then stop. Do not compress it as far as it will go.
</p>

<h3>
  8. The square nut in front of the pump body leaks; what is wrong and how do I
  fix it?
</h3>

<p>
  The square nut in front of the pump body is an air inlet valve that allows air
  into the top of the pump cylinder during dry flush operation to stop any
  Vacuum kick. Inside the square fitting is a check valve.
</p>

<p>
  In units manufactured between 1981 and March, 1992, a small black joker valve
  was used; in units manufactured after March 1992; a more advanced valve is
  used. In either case, remove the fitting and rinse it with warm, clear water.
  Reassemble. If it still leaks, replace it (part # 1203W).
</p>

<h3>
  9. The intake valve handle is hard to turn; how do I make this easier to
  rotate?
</h3>

<p>
  Remove the round handle, unscrew the packing nut (1204B) and remove the intake
  valve body (1203B). Grease the three &quot;O&quot; rings with SuperLube or
  other PTFE based grease. Reassemble, referring to correct alignment of valve
  in the PHII owner&#39;s manual. If it continues being difficult to turn,
  replace the intake valve body (1203BW).
</p>

<p>
  Note: older PHII series valve handles didn&#39;t have the two
  &quot;wings&quot; on the handle to aid in turning it. Customer may wish to
  purchase a new handle (1209BW).
</p>

<h3>10. I have an older model PH toilet (pre-1981); can I still get parts?</h3>

<p>
  Some parts remain available but we recommend that the pump assembly be
  upgraded to the newer PHIIPUMP Current handle socket, fulcrum links, yoke,
  clevis pins, base, flapper, joker, bowl and seat are all interchangeable with
  the older series; gearboxes are not - Customer Service should be consulted
  when upgrading old PHE models to the newer PHEII models.
</p>

<h3>11. Can PHII be connected to a pressurized fresh water supply?</h3>

<p>
  No. The PHII inlet as it is can only be connected to a non-pressurized water
  source such as sea cock. There is a conversion kit available to allow
  connection to your on board pressurized freshwater system. See Fresh Head and
  conversion # 2500RFK.
</p>

<h3>

<p>
  Raritan toilets are not by themselves designed to hold water unless a vented
  loop is installed in the discharge line with the top of the loop generally 4
  inches higher than the top of the bowl. The higher the loop the more water

<h2 id="purasan">PURASAN/PST EX</h2>

<h3>1. Is the Purasan EX legal to use?</h3>

<p>
  Yes and No. The Purasan EX waste treatment system is a U.S. Coast Guard
  certified Type I waste treatment system permitted on uninspected vessels less
  than 65 feet. They may be used in most navigable waterways with an in and out
  tidal flow within the 3 mile limit (9 miles in the Gulf of Mexico). There are
  areas however that are federally designated as No-Discharge Zones
  (NDZ&rsquo;s) and its use is not permitted. Please see the EPA&rsquo;s website
  for no discharge zones for a state by state listing.
</p>

<h3>2. What is the difference between the Purasan EX and the Electroscan?</h3>

<p>
  The Purasan EX uses a Halogen chemical solution dispensed through a remote
  dispenser for disinfection. Special tablets must be replenished as needed and
  an onboard pressurized system is required to fill the dispenser during each
  treatment cycle (about 8 ounces per cycle). Amp draw at nominal 12VDC is 10
  amps.
</p>

<p>
  The Electroscan disinfects waste by converting salt water into a powerful
  bactericide. No tablets are needed but salt is required to make this system
  function properly. If adequate salt water is not available (e.g. brackish or
  freshwater applications), salt feed systems may be added to the system.
</p>

<p>
  While the Purasan is typically used in freshwater application and the
  Electroscan in salt water applications, either system can be used in each
  application.
</p>

<h3>3. What is the power requirement for the Purasan EX?</h3>

<p>Approximately .4 amp/hour per cycle.</p>

<h3>4. How do I winterize my Purasan Ex?</h3>

<p>
  Refer to winterizing instructions in owner&#39;s manual.
  (http://www.raritaneng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/L518Av1115PSTEXvP70vOM.pdf)
</p>

<h3>
  5. Can you run a PSTEX with an electrical transformer? Can you add a toilet
  also?
</h3>

<p>
  Purasan EX 12V will work with RTME transformer. Separate transformers are
  needed for PSTEX and toilet. Same transformer cannot be used for both. If
  PSTEX is used with &quot;hold and treat &quot;addition consideration are
  required to power drawn by transfer macerator pump. Please contact with
  Raritan tech support.
</p>

<h3>
  6. How many flushes / cycles per tablet do you get using a Purasan waste
  treatment system?
</h3>

<p>
  Typically each tablet lasts for 50 cycles , but many factors such as water
  level in tablet dispenser can increase or decrease usage.
</p>

<p>Purasan cartridge in older Purasan can lasts for 300 cycles on average.</p>

<h3>7. Can Purasan EX be used with raw water inlet from thru-hull?</h3>

<h2 id="seaera">SeaEra</h2>

<h3>1. The toilet flushes poorly or not at all.</h3>

<p>
  The most common cause to poor discharge is a clogged sanitation line. We
  recommend isolating the toilet from the plumbing system by connecting a
  separate piece of hose to the toilet discharge and flushing into a bucket. If
  the toilet flushes fine, you either have an obstruction in the sanitation
  line, Y-valve, vented loop, vent line or sea cock. If the toilet continues to
  perform poorly, refer to the owners guide for further troubleshooting.
</p>

<h3>2. Dirty water comes back in the bowl after a flush.</h3>

<p>
  The most common cause of back flow is Joker Valve wear. Replacement Joker
  valve is part# C254.
</p>

<h3>
  3. My toilet overflows with sea water when I run at high speeds? How do I
  correct this situation?
</h3>

<p>
  One of the most common issues relates to the type of scoop on your thru hull.
  If the scoop is oriented to &quot;cup&quot; the water when the boat is in
  motion, the water will do as you describe. Reversing this scoop will take care
  of this problem.
</p>

<h3>4. No water stands in the bowl after the cycle, why not?</h3>

<p>
  Raritan toilets are not designed to hold water unless a vented loop is
  installed in the discharge line with the top of the loop generally 4 inches
  higher than the top of the bowl. See the specific toilets installation manual
  for specifications and loop height limitations.
</p>

<p>
  If a vented loop is installed, check for clogged vent. A clogged vent will
  cause water to siphon out of the bowl.
</p>

<h3>
  5. Do I need to cut 1&quot; portion of the discharge if using 1 &frac12;&quot;
  hose?
</h3>

<p>
  No. The discharge fitting was designed to accept both 1&quot; and 1
  &frac12;&quot; I.D. discharge hoses. Modification for 1 &frac12;&quot;
  installations is not necessary and will not adversely affect performance.
</p>

<h3>
  6. My toilet works but smells, what&#39;s wrong with it and how do I get rid
  of the odors?
</h3>

<p>
  The most common source of odor is almost never associated with the toilet
  itself. Odor is typically caused by one of three factors and can be

    the toilet.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, we attack the odor from its source. We recommend installing our

    the intake water line that will prevent the growth of the bacteria that
    cause the rotten egg smell. It will not only eliminate the growth of bad
    bacteria but it will also clean the head as well.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Holding Tank- If the odor you are experiencing smells more like waste rather
  than rotten eggs, the odor is likely coming from your holding tank. You will
  find several items on the market that will work to cover up this odor (e.g.
  formaldehyde based chemicals, vent filters, etc&hellip;). Raritan recommends
  our Kills Odor product (K.O.) which works to eliminate the odor at its source.
  K.O. utilizes live odor-killing bacteria which digests liquids, solid waste
  and paper, totally emulsifying them so there&rsquo;s no need to add
  &quot;tissue digesters&quot; or other &quot;boosters&quot; to your system. The
  bacteria in K.O. neutralize the odor-causing elements in waste, effectively
  converting the contents of your holding tank to an odor-free product. Four
  ounces per 25 gallons of capacity is all you need, and there&rsquo;s seldom
  any need to add K.O. between pump-outs; or need to pump out until the tank is
  full, making K.O. less expensive to use than lower-priced products.
</p>

<p>
  Sanitation Hose-Poor quality and/or improperly routed sanitation hose will
  eventually permeate your sanitation hose. The only solution for permeated hose
  is replacement. If you suspect your hose may be permeated, wet a rag as hot as
  possible and wrap it around the suspect hose. After it cools, remove and smell
  the rag. If the odor has transferred to the rag, the hose is permeated and
  replacement is necessary. Raritan offers our Saniflex sanitation line which is
  made with a butyl rubber to resist permeation and is backed with a 5 year
  warranty. Its flexibility is unmatched in the market place and heating of the
  hose to install fittings is not necessary. Part number is SFH for 1.5&quot;
  and SFH1 for 1&quot; I.D. hose.
</p>

<p>
  Note: it is always recommended to route hoses to gravitate downhill and use
  sweep ells rather than 90 degree fittings to make bends if needed. Avoid any
  dips and sags in the lines so waste cannot settle and collect and cause
  premature failure of your sanitation line. Any loops in the hose must also be
  properly vented.
</p>

<h3>7. What can I use to clean my toilet:</h3>

<p>
  Raritan only recommends our Cleans Potties product (part# 1PCP22) C.P. was the
  first bowl cleaner of its kind to combine a specialized strain of bacteria
  with 100% biodegradable cleaning agent. This bio active formula effectively
  breaks down waste while also leaving the toilet fresh and clean. Other market
  cleaners may contain pine oil, formaldehyde, chlorine, phosphoric acid or
  other solvent or petroleum based products that can damage plastic and rubber
  parts within the head.
</p>

<h3>8. How do I winterize my toilet?</h3>

<p>
  Refer to detail winterizing instructions in owner&#39;s
  manual.(http://raritaneng.app-x.info/pdf_files/sea_era/L318seaerav0103.pdf)
</p>

<h3>9. What discharge hose size do you recommend?</h3>

<p>
  Our toilets are designed to perform well using either 1&quot; or 1
  &frac12;&quot; I.D. hose. We do however suggest 1 1/2&quot; hose be used in
  salt water applications due to calcium deposition. A smaller diameter hose
  will obstruct more quickly in these conditions and adversely affect the
  performance of your toilet.
</p>

<h3>10. Can I purchase a SeaEra with a 1&quot; 90 degree discharge fitting?</h3>

<p>
  No. We recommend purchasing an inline 1 &frac12;&quot; to 1&quot; barbed
  nipple through a local plumbing supply outfit.

<h2 id="ventedloop">Vented Loop</h2>

<h3>1. Water comes out from vent of my vented loop? What should I do?</h3>

<p>
  Vent from vented loop (1 1/2&quot;) should be vented outside. Also vent should
  be vented higher than the loop. Vented loop supplied by Previous Raritan
  vented loops did not have check valve (duckbill valve) in the vent. If vent
  does not have check valve then vent need to be vented outside. For all
  TrueDesign vented loops, replace or clean check valve to stop leak.
</p>

<h3>2. How high do I mount my vented loop above the waterline?</h3>

<p>
  The top of the vented loop must be a minimum of 4&quot; (10cm) above the
  waterline at the boats greatest angle of heel.

<h2 id="holdntreat">Hold N&rsquo; Treat</h2>

<h3>1. Can I use existing holding tank to convert to hold and treat?</h3>

<p>
  Raritan has system component to use existing holding tank, macerator pump to
  build a hold and treat system.
</p>

<h3>
  2. Can I treat waste first and store in holding tank to discharge later?
</h3>

<p>
  Treated waste from electroscan and Purasan if stored in a holding tank can
  grow coliform again and hence does not meet USCG requirement. Holding waste
  first and treating at the time of the discharge in only USCG approved system.

<h2 id="waterheater">Water Heaters</h2>

<h3>1. What is the heat exchanger; how does it work?</h3>

<p>
  The heat exchanger is a coil inside the tank through which a portion of your
  engine&#39;s coolant is circulated, enabling you to have hot water while away
  from the dock without having to turn on your genset.
</p>

<h3>
  2. The pressure relief valve on my water heater keeps dripping. What is wrong?
</h3>

<p>
  The pressure relief valves used in Raritan water heaters are set for 75 PSI or
  210&deg; F. If water temperature or pressure inside the tank exceeds these
  limits, the valve will unseat.
</p>

<p>
  If engine coolant is being used in a Raritan water heater with heat exchanger,
  some of the engine coolant may have to be diverted via a bypass valve, to
  insure that the water in the tank does not exceed the limits of the pressure
  relief valve.
</p>

<p>
  If there is a check valve installed din inlet to water heater and all hot
  water faucets are closed during the heating cycle, there is a thermal
  expansion of water. This expansion builds high pressure in the tank causing
  drip in T&amp;P valve. Remove check valve and use plumbing according to the
  manual. Raritan supplies the water heater with a 75 psi T&amp;P valve, if your
  water pressure system can safely operate at higher pressures, a higher rated
  T&amp;P valve may be installed.
</p>

<h3>3. How do I winterize my water heater?</h3>

<p>
  Refer to winterizing instructions in owner&#39;s manual.
  (http://www.raritaneng.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/L206V0911v1700WaterHeaterOM.pdf)
</p>

<h3>
  4. What is the recovery rate of a Raritan 1700 series water heater using AC
  power (heating element)?
</h3>

<p>
  In one hour, 13 gallons U.S (49.2 Liter) of water will be heated approximately
  40&deg; F (22&deg; C).
</p>

<h3>
  5. Where is the anode on the heater and how do I remove the anode without
  damaging the threads?
</h3>

<p>
  Please refer to the following instructions: Raritan-Water-Heaters-Anode
  (http://raritaneng.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Raritan-Water-Heaters-Anode.png)
</p>

<h3>
  6. The hot water coming out of my hot water heater smells like sulfur. Why and
  how do I get rid of it?
</h3>

<p>
  The most common cause of &quot;smelly water&quot; is a non-toxic sulfate
  reducing bacteria, scientifically termed Divibrio Sulfurcans. This bacteria
  often enter the water system through construction or a break in ground piping.
  The bacteria creates the energy it needs to survive by converting sulfate
  (SO4) to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas you smell in the water. Hydrogen sulfide
  gas is distinctive because of its rotten egg-like stench. Its presence can
  severely affect the taste as well as the odor of the water. Occasionally this
  bacteria can be accompanied by black deposits, the result of pipe and fitting
  corrosion. In extremely high concentrations, hydrogen sulfide gas can be toxic
  though the gas is detectable long before harmful levels are reached.
</p>

<p>
  The requirements for the bacteria to thrive are: a) an elevated level of
  sulfur in the water, b) activated hydrogen from cathodic reactions within the
  tank, c) water with little or no dissolved oxygen, d) and temperatures below
  138&deg;F. Items that can increase the potential for this bacteria are: a)
  water softeners, b) well water, c) and long periods of no water movement.
</p>

<p>Other factors that may contribute to smelly water:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Chlorides of Magnesium and Calcium leave a bitter taste.</li>
  <li>Chloride of Sodium produces a salty taste.</li>
  <li>Sulfates (50 ppm) gives a medicinal taste.</li>
  <li>Carbon Dioxide in a low pH water gives fizzy water.</li>
  <li>Iron and tannic waters also give a bad taste and odor.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The simplest treatment available is the shock-chlorination of the system. This
  is a surface treatment, and often requires repeated trials in heavily infected
  systems. The chlorination of a system requires that you follow each step
  explicitly to avoid an un-treated portion of the piping system from
  re-infecting another part. Longer lasting solutions include chlorination or
  aeration of the water supply.
